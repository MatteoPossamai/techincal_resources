# String

A string is a data structure, that is a sequence of characters, all that are stored like a number that rappresents the ASCII code of the character. It is usually implemented in different ways, depending on the programming language, but the most common way is to store the string as an array of characters.
In some languages, strings are mutuable, but in other they are immutable. This means that in some languages you can change the value of a string, while in other you cannot. In Python, for example, strings are immutable, while in C++ they are mutable. If is is immutable, you need to create a new instance.
