# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

This technique is used to solve problems that can be broken down into subproblems. The subproblems are solved and stored in a table. The solution to the original problem is then obtained by combining the solutions to the subproblems.

They tends to use also equations to solve the subproblems, that are used and reiterated each time we add complexity to the problem. It use to store data (memoization) to avoid solving the same subproblem twice (Fibonacci optimized).
